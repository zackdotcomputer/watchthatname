# Watch That Name

Watch That Name is an open source experiment at using [RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com) and (Clerk)[https://clerk.dev] to make a lightweight product in under 72 hours.

It has several outstanding issues with it that mean you should probably use it as a reference for "how to do things" rather than as a direct source.

- [ ] Does not make use of storyboards or tests that Redwood provides
- [ ] Does not adequately explain what it is or why you should use it
- [ ] Does not yet integrate any sort of monetization
- [ ] Built in 72 hours, have done zero quality assurance testing
